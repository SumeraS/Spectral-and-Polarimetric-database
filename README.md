# Spectral-and-Polarimetric-database
A database of spectral and polarimetric images acquired from stereoscopic acquisition system in visible region.

The folder name "Data raw" contains left images acquired from the left camera with GG47 yellow (y) filter. The right images are captured using the right camera with a BG-39 blue-green (bg) filter. The images are stored in alphabetical order in the folder as depicted in Figure 5 of the paper. However, the dark left and dark right are the dark noise images captured from the left and right cameras. The left and right white chart images are "white balance chart" to correct the spatial non-uniformity. The stereo parameter of our acquisition system is available in the parameter folder.
