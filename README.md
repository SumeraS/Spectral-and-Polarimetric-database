# Spectral-and-Polarimetric-database
A database of spectral and polarimetric images acquired from stereoscopic acquisition system in visible region.

The folder name "Geometric_corrected_database" contains "y" images acquired from the left camera with GG47 yellow (y) filter. The right images with name "bg" are captured using the right camera with a BG-39 blue-green (bg) filter. The images are stored with name as depicted in Figure 5 of the paper.

For Stokes formalisam, Spectral images generation and color images code are given with respective title.
